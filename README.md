## Restaurant Reviews: Stage 1

 The goal of this application is to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application that focuses on accessibility. I converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to create a seamless offline experience for all users. I utilized Web Server for Chrome to run my server and used the Chrome Web Fundamentals guide on Service Workers to implement caching of assets.

 I utilized the Chrome Developer Tools Audits feature to improve scores for Accessibility to 90, SEO to 100, Best Practices to 93, and Performance to 86.
